                "html": "<p>In a small village nestled between snow-covered mountains, life was simple yet challenging. The village, Snowvale, was a quaint place where chimneys puffed smoke into the cold air, and the cobblestone streets were lined with wooden cottages. At the very edge of the village stood a small, weather-worn cabin. It seemed almost too fragile to withstand the harsh winters, but it was home to a young boy named Liam.</p><p>Liam was only twelve years old, but life had already taught him to be resilient. His parents had passed away when he was very young, leaving him to grow up alone. The villagers did their best to look after him, offering food and kind words when they could, but they had their own struggles to face. Despite the loneliness that often accompanied him, Liam had a warm heart and a quiet determination. His bright blue eyes, framed by untidy brown hair, were filled with curiosity and a longing for connection.</p><p>Each day, Liam wandered through the snowy woods surrounding the village. He would talk to the birds, watch the deer, and listen to the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. He liked to imagine that the woods were his secret world, where he wasn’t alone. Still, he wished for a friend—someone who would truly understand him.</p><p>One frosty evening, as Liam sat by a frozen creek, he heard the crunch of snow behind him. Turning around, he saw an old man with a long silver beard and kind, twinkling eyes. The man wore simple, ragged clothes and carried a large sack over his shoulder.</p><p>“Hello, young one,” the man said warmly. “What brings you out here in the cold?”</p><p>“I like it here,” Liam replied, unsure whether to feel curious or cautious. “It’s peaceful. Who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Nicholas,” the man said with a gentle smile. “I’m just a traveler passing through. And you?”</p><p>“I’m Liam,” the boy answered, his voice soft but steady.</p><p>From that day on, Nicholas and Liam became inseparable. Nicholas was unlike anyone Liam had ever met. His laughter was hearty and comforting, his stories were enchanting, and he seemed to make even the coldest days feel warm. They spent hours together, building snowmen, exploring the woods, and sledding down hills. Nicholas often brought small gifts—an apple, a carved trinket, or a loaf of bread. To Liam, he was more than a friend; he was family.</p><p>What Liam didn’t know was that Nicholas was no ordinary traveler. He was Santa Claus, taking time away from his usual duties to bring joy and companionship to a boy who needed it most.</p><p>One day, while delivering toys to a villager in town, Liam met Eliza, the blacksmith’s daughter. Eliza had just moved to Snowvale and was about Liam’s age. She had fiery red hair that shone like embers against the snowy backdrop and a laugh that could brighten the gloomiest day. Despite her bold demeanor, Eliza was gentle and kind. They quickly became friends, spending hours together exploring the village, playing in the snow, and sharing stories by the fire.</p><p>Eliza’s presence brought new joy to Liam’s life. She often visited his little cabin, bringing freshly baked bread or warm soup. The once lonely home began to feel alive with laughter and warmth. Nicholas, watching from the sidelines, felt a deep sense of happiness seeing Liam thrive.</p><p>Under Nicholas’s guidance, Liam discovered a talent for carving wood. He began making simple toys—wooden animals, carts, and dolls. Eliza, ever resourceful, helped him set up a small workshop in his cabin. Soon, Liam’s toys became popular in Snowvale and beyond. Villagers came to him with orders, marveling at his skill. His success brought pride to the village, which had long been overshadowed by hardship.</p><p>As the years passed, Liam grew into a strong and kind young man. His bond with Eliza deepened, and the two fell in love. Together, they expanded the workshop, creating not just toys but hope for their community. Snowvale, once a quiet and struggling village, began to flourish.</p><p>On Christmas Eve, the village was alive with celebration. Candles lit up the square, carolers sang, and the air was filled with the scent of roasted chestnuts. Liam and Eliza stood hand in hand, marveling at how far they had come. Nicholas, ever the mysterious friend, joined them by the large Christmas tree.</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Nicholas said with a playful grin. “I have a surprise for you.”</p><p>Liam and Eliza exchanged curious glances but obeyed. When they opened their eyes, Nicholas was no longer the simple traveler they had known. Standing before them was Santa Claus, dressed in a bright red coat trimmed with white fur, his silver beard glowing under the starlight. A sleigh filled with gifts stood behind him, and reindeer pawed at the snow.</p><p>“You’re Santa Claus?” Liam whispered, his voice filled with wonder.</p><p>Santa smiled. “Yes, my dear friends. But more importantly, I am your friend. You have brought joy, love, and hope to this village, and for that, I am grateful.”</p><p>Liam and Eliza stood in awe, their hearts swelling with gratitude and amazement. Santa placed a hand on Liam’s shoulder and said, “You have shown that even in the hardest times, kindness and love can light the way. That is the true spirit of Christmas.”</p><p>With that, Santa climbed into his sleigh, waved goodbye, and disappeared into the starry sky. Liam and Eliza watched until the golden trail of light faded, their hearts full of wonder.</p><p>In the years that followed, Liam and Eliza continued to bring joy to Snowvale. Their love, kindness, and hard work transformed the village into a thriving, happy place. And every Christmas Eve, they would look up at the stars, remembering the friend who had shown them the magic of love and friendship.</p>",

It ensures the snow stays on top of everything without interfering with clicks.</li><li><strong>The Snowflakes</strong>: Each snowflake <code>div</code> has a random size, opacity, and drift value. It’s styled with CSS and animated using <code>@keyframes</code>.</li><li><strong>The Animation</strong>: The <code>@keyframes</code> animation makes the snowflakes fall vertically while swaying horizontally for a natural effect. 🌨️</li><li><strong>The JavaScript Magic</strong>: JavaScript handles the creation of snowflakes, randomizing their properties and removing them once they’re out of view.</li></ol><hr><h3 id=\"make-it-yours-%F0%9F%8E%A8\">Make It Yours 🎨</h3><p>Customizing the snowfall effect is where the real fun begins! 🌟 Here’s how you can make it uniquely yours. Start by adjusting the <code>snowflakeCount</code> variable to control density, tweak the <code>animation-duration</code> for speed, or swap out <code>‘❄’</code> for emojis like snowmen ☃️ or stars ✨. It’s your canvas, so let your creativity shine!</p><hr><h3 id=\"final-thoughts-%E2%9C%A8\">Final Thoughts ✨</h3><p>Everyone has their own way of celebrating, and this is mine!

It’s about being valued for who we are, not what others expect from us.</p><p>Many people feel judged whenever they make decisions. If their dreams don’t fit the expectations, their voices feel ignored. Those wanting a creative career or to start a business are often told, \"It’s too risky\" or \"It’s not practical\". This isn’t love—it’s fear of change. Fear of standing out and fear of failure. Sometimes, people are held back because of old beliefs rather than their potential.</p><p>Traditions can offer comfort, but they can also feel like chains. There’s pressure to fit into a mold—whether it’s for family, stability, or what’s considered \"right\". Where is the promised independence? Life often feels planned by others. The career, love, or freedom you want is only allowed if it fits expectations. This isn’t just about feeling trapped—it’s about the emotional toll of feeling misunderstood, frustrated, and afraid of letting others down.</p><p>It’s time for a change. Society needs to realize that love isn’t control. People need the freedom to make their own choices, live their dreams, and be themselves. To everyone struggling with these pressures: Your dreams and voice matter. It’s okay to feel lost or want something different. It’s okay to fight for the life you want.</p><p>Change takes time, but it begins with the courage to be true to ourselves, embracing the freedom to dream, grow, and shine in our own unique way.</p>",

And here I am, celebrating not only two full years as a UI designer but also reflecting on the incredible journey that led me here. It’s been a wild ride, and now, as I enter my third and final year of BCA, I can’t help but think about how it all started.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/dbzgbdyvv/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost/Meq-modified.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\"></figure><p>Let’s rewind to when I was in 9th grade. My school introduced a club called Little KITES (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education). Back then, I had no clue what it was all about. But I was curious and joined anyway. Little did I know, that decision would change my life. Through KITES, I got to attend several tech camps and, surprisingly, even had the chance to teach my friends, juniors, and seniors. That experience taught me one of the most valuable lessons: I could be both a student and a mentor. And this was just the beginning.</p><p>I started off by dabbling in IoT, experimenting with microcontrollers, but it didn’t exactly give me the excitement I was hoping for. So, I moved on and explored different creative fields—Scratch, Python, Visual Designing, Photography, Web Development, Blender, and TupiTube (remember that?). I tried everything, and although it was overwhelming at times, I eventually focused on what I truly loved: Designing and Web Development.</p><p>During my school years, I was the go-to designer—creating cover pages, posters, event banners, and even a school magazine. If it needed a creative touch, I was the one everyone turned to. I also began giving design sessions to my friends and peers. But, here’s the thing: I wasn’t the brightest student academically. I was always somewhere in the middle, around 5th or 6th. But, somehow, I managed to score 96% in my SSLC exams. Who knew?</p><p>And then came the pandemic. Suddenly, we were all at home, attending online classes. But instead of just sitting there, I decided to make the most of my time. I dove deep into video editing—Kinemaster, Inshot, Capcut, VN Editor, Node Video Editor, Alight Motion. I explored every tool I could find. And let’s not forget about Pixellab, Picsart, and Canva. I created wedding videos, social media reels, posters, and logos for shops and travel agencies—all for free. My parents, of course, were convinced I was just wasting time on my phone, but little did they know, I was investing in my creativity!</p><p>During this time, I also got into some cyber-related stuff, including ethical hacking. It wasn’t all smooth sailing, though. Some of my experiences were a bit scary—imagine learning to hack and then facing the consequences of mistakes. But hey, it was all part of the learning process.</p><p>When college started, I walked in with a bit of design experience and some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. That’s when I stumbled upon Inovus Labs IEDC, a student community at my college. I attended their orientation session, and that’s when I realized something important: the BCA syllabus wasn’t going to cut it in the fast-evolving world. It wasn’t about degrees or textbooks—it was about skills.</p><p>Through Inovus, I met some incredible seniors who introduced me to Figma. This was a game-changer. I quickly fell in love with UI/UX design and decided to dive deep into it. I even landed my first internship as a designer with Inovus Labs. Around that time, I bought my first laptop—not a high-end machine, but it did the job. I used it for Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma Web. I had a rocky start with Illustrator, so I focused on what worked best for me—Figma and Photoshop. Slowly, Figma became my go-to tool for creating posters, logos, and mockups. It was like my second partner in crime.</p><p>The internship gave me tons of experience, and I eventually became the Chief Creative Officer (CCO) at Inovus. But to be honest, titles don’t mean much to me. In Inovus, everyone is a peer, learning from each other. It’s a place where I discovered my passion for UI/UX design and got the chance to volunteer as a UI/UX designer for Kerala Police Cyberdome. Later, I also got an internship as a graphic designer at GTech MuLearn.</p><p>Through all of this, Inovus gave me countless opportunities to mentor others, lead sessions, and continue learning. Being a designer and a mentor at the same time was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. It wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding.</p><p>And now, I’m proud to say I’m the COO of Inovus Labs, where I manage projects, events, and design. All these experiences, both as a designer and a mentor, have helped me develop skills in team management, project management, event coordination, and even development. Yes, I’m a designer at heart, but I also manage a bit of development on the side—JavaScript, Python, React, HTML, CSS, and even Telegram bots. It’s been a crazy but exciting journey.</p><p>Looking back, I’ve worn many hats: freelance designer, intern, mentor, volunteer, and COO. And through it all, I’ve learned one thing that stands out: It’s not about the software or the tools you use. Whether it’s Figma, Photoshop, or even some obscure editing app, it’s your creativity and skills that matter most.</p><p>As I celebrate my second year in UI design, I also reflect on the years of experimenting, learning, and growing in the broader field of design. Here’s to many more years of creativity, challenges, and growth.</p>",
